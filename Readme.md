## New Zealand emission unit (NZU) prices

This repository features prices of the [New Zealand emission unit](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/ets/nz-ets-market/where-to-buy-new-zealand-emissions-units) or NZU. The NZU is the "the primary domestic unit of trade" in the [New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme](https://www.climatecommission.govt.nz/get-involved/new-content-page/what-is-the-nz-ets/). 

The price data has been web-scraped by a Python script 'api.py' (which was kindly contributed by [Edi Rose](https://github.com/edi-rose/)). and saved to a .csv file [nzu-edited-raw-prices-data.csv](https://github.com/theecanmole/NZ-emission-unit-prices/blob/main/nzu-edited-raw-prices-data.csv).

The prices are then processed in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) via commands in a R script file [nzu.r](https://github.com/theecanmole/NZ-emission-unit-prices/blob/main/nzu.r) into data sets of;

* [average monthly prices](https://github.com/theecanmole/NZ-emission-unit-prices/blob/main/nzu-month-price.csv) 
* [average weekly prices (with the missing values filled by linear interpolation)](https://github.com/theecanmole/NZ-emission-unit-prices/blob/main/weeklypricefilled.csv) 
* [spot prices (with missing values)](https://github.com/theecanmole/nz-emission-unit-prices/blob/main/spotprices.csv).
* [spot prices (with the missing values filled by linear interpolation)](spotpricesinfilled.csv)
* [21 day rolling mean of the infilled spot prices](spotrollmean31.csv)

These sets of price data are charted in R Ggplot2. 

### 2025 prices

So far 2025 prices have declined well below the 2024 auction reserve price of $64. Let alone the 2025 reserve price. There seems to have been no clear price response to the [Government's announcement](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/setting-new-zealand%E2%80%99s-second-international-climate-target) of the Paris Agreement 2035 emissions target. The 19 March auction failed to sell any units.

### 2024 prices

In December 2024 there was a log-jam of five Government policy announcements as well as a partly-cleared unit auction. There was a brief $4 dip in NZU price before it recovered to $63 on 17 December 2024.

Lets look back at price trends in 2024. Until the first auction on 20 March 2024, the spot price was consistently above the auction minimum price of $64. The [March auction partly cleared](https://www.etsauctions.govt.nz/public/auction_noticeboard/50). Bids for 3 million units (out of 3.5 million available) were accepted as so those bids must have been greater than the auction reserve price. And the unfilled bids must have been less than the reserve price. The price fell sharply from 65.40 on 20 March to 51.00 on 21 March 2024.

In the 19 June auction, [bids did not meet the reserve price](https://www.etsauctions.govt.nz/public/auction_noticeboard/52) and no bids were accepted. There was a small uptick in price and the trend reversed from downward to upward. 

On 20 August 2024, Minister for Climate Change, Simon Watts [announced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/updated-settings-restore-ets-market-confidence) the [Annual updates to emission unit limits and price control settings](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/ets/nz-ets-market/annual-updates-to-emission-unit-limits-and-price-control-settings/). It appears there was  an immediate overnight 'bump' of $5 in the NZU price in response.

The [4 September 2024 auction](https://www.etsauctions.govt.nz/public/auction_noticeboard/54) did not clear as there were no bids. There was no obvious response in the spot price. After the auction the price trend showed a slow convergence back to the 64.00 minimum auction price

"The [4 December 2024 auction](https://www.etsauctions.govt.nz/public/auction_noticeboard/60) part cleared and 4,032,500 units were sold at exactly 64.00. Again there was no obvious response in the spot price on 5 December.

### This graph is the mean price for each calendar month.

### This graph is the spot prices of trading on week days
It is an irregular time series. When trading of units started in 2010, the volume of trades was sufficiently low that several days or weeks could pass by without any trading.

### This graph displays the spot prices from November 2022 to December 2023
I have marked with blue dashed horizontal lines two dates where Government announcements 'surprised' the market and the price changed sharply. The first was on 16 December 2022, when the Labour Government decided not to follow the price advice from the Climate Change Commission [Price of carbon plummets in response to Cabinet rejection of Climate Change Commission recommendations](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/story.asp?storyID=26749).

### This graph is the spot prices from December 2022 to December 2023
Blue dashed horizontal lines mark the dates of the quarterly NZU auctions. The December 2022 auction met it's reserve price. The four 2023 auctions did not meet the reserve price and no units were sold.
