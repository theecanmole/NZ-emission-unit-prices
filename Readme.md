## New Zealand emission unit (NZU) prices

This repository features New Zealand emission unit (NZU) prices web-scraped via Python (api.py file) and saved to a .csv file.

The prices are then processed in the R programming language (nzu.r file) into data sets of average monthly price, average weekly price and spot prices.

The price data is then charted in Base R and in Ggplot2.
